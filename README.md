# gesture-LED

a system that turns an LED on when certain hand gestures are made
The idea is when the computer sees an open hand, it turns on an LED and it stays on, it does the opposite for when it sees a closed hand

NOTE:
~ you have to run python main.py first to get images of hands
~ then you can run python landmark_img.py to add landmarks to the images you saved
